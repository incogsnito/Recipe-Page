<h1>Recipe Page</h1>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This github repository contains a one page repository to a layout made for a Front-end Mentor challenge.</p>
<p>It includes the ingredients you need to make an omelette. It's filled with HTML elements like the header, table, ul and ol's.</p>
<p>You'll find once you open the page of course the recipe to an Omelette.</p>

<h2>Personal Experience</h2>
<p>This was my first conquered layout since I finished a course on Css responsiveness.</p>
<p>Completing this, I am one step closer to acheiving my goals, It was a fun experience and difficult at first.</p>

<h2>Trails</h2>
<p>Making this layout helped me reinforce my knowledge and question the things I once thought true</p>
<p>My first attempt making this layout was a complete disaster. I failed a lot, ran into bugs I didn't know how to fix and my problem solving skills were definitely lacking.</p>
<p>I would have problems with making everything alligned properly and almost quit this challenge to move on to something else.</p>

<h2>Resolutions+</h2>
<p>To solve this, I took a step back from this project to learn some things that I needed.</p>
<p>In the process I discovered media queries, css displays, alignment, clamps and making things faster and simpler with out writing long and over complicated code</p>
<p>I then came back with my newly attained knowledge and absolutely conquered this challenge. The things I once deemed impossible now seemed like common sense things.</p>
<p>Taking the time to learn more about what I was doing stream-lined the process of making this, found more efficient ways to solve problems, stressed my thinking muscles, etc.</p>

<h2>Recurring problems</h2>
<p>I noticed when I zoomed out of my page that everything would become too small except for the image.</p>
<p>Setting t everything related to the texts(fonts) would get extremely complicated and messy. I need a more structured way to make them as when it becomes too much everything becomes messy and it's tedious to (re)write. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This challenge was fun to do, deepening my skills and increasing my love for coding. Can't wait to make my next layout. </p>
